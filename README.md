#cellular-automata

This repository contains a beggining of a general library for cellular automata
and the implementation of some classics automata for testing.

All of this codes have been developed in the programming language C++
version 14 and the examples are implemented by using the Library Qt5 for
visualizing them. Some of the examples also use codes from the repository
Common (https://github.com/R3mmurd/common) and the library Aleph-w available
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/aleph-w/.

In the examples codes you should edit the file with .pro extention in order to
configure the routes where you have installed the Aleph-w library and the
directory Common.
