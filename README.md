# Cellular Automata

This repository contains the implementation of some classics
[cellular automata](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cellular-automata/)
problems and a basic general library to build models.

All of these codes have been developed in the programming language C++
version 14 and the examples are implemented by using the Library Qt5
to visualize them.

## Content

This repository is structured as follows:

- **[LibCA](LibCA/README.md)**: Contains a basic general library to
  build cellular automata models.

  Contains the implementation of the simpler model of cellular automata.

- **[GameOfLife](GameOfLife/README.md)**: Contains the implementation of the
  [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
  model.
  
  - **[BriansBrain](BriansBrain/README.md)**: Contains the implementation of the
  [Brian's Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian%27s_Brain) model.

- **[Earthquake2D](Earthquake2D/README.md)**: Contains a basic simulation of
  earthquakes with cellular automata.

- **[TuringPatterns](TuringPatterns/README.md)**: Contains a basic simulation
